## Design philosophy and features

When a major design company creates a high-end product, design or interface, they invest immense amount of theory and knowledge to make a harmonic and consistent design.

The rest of us are working on a limited budgets or maybe even lack knowledge of concepts such as "grid system", "golden ratio", "baseline", "color palettes".

We decided to create AgileToolkit CSS to make it super easy for designers and developers to create a great looking websites with minimum effort and knowledge.

### Widgets built with Components

AgileToolkit CSS uses a concept of Widgets and Components. Below is a widget example. Each class starting with "atk-" is what we call a component (atk-box, atk-jackscrew, etc)

    <div class="atk-cells atk-cells-gutter-large atk-box atk-swatch-yellow">
        <div class="atk-cell">
            <img src="playground/temp/tomatoes.jpg" alt="Tomatoes">
        </div>
        <div class="atk-cell atk-valign-middle atk-jackscrew">
            <h4>Tomatoes</h4>
            <p>Donec dolor sapien, sollicitudin in erat ac.</p>
            <hr class="small">
            <a href="#"><span class="icon-down-circled-1"></span>Download</a>
        </div>
    </div>

The HTML and classes are used to describe the structure of a widget and behavior of it's elements. Here are some of the components explained:

 - atk-cells - creates columns for interior content of a div
 - atk-cells-gutter-large - sets a "large" gutter
 - atk-box - defines a paddings and border shapes of a div
 - atk-swatch-yellow - picks a yellow color from default palette
 - atk-cell - used for flexible vertical columns
 - atk-valign-middle - defines vertical alignment of content
 - atk-jackscrew - expands cell to fill maximum width

My Combining a known and re-usable components a designer or a developer can create any User Interface Object and easily adjust the layout.

### Design in only one way - the right way

The previous example enables you to use round corners, paddings and layouts but it does not let you adjust individual paddings, corner radius, font sizes or color tones. The purpose of this limitation is to only enable "Theme Designer" to adjust those values through extensive LESS settings.

Implied limitations and variety of components makes it possible to create interfaces in only one possible way: how the theme designer have intended. On other hand, it gives a freedom to create any content variations which will still be consistent with theme settings.

### Simple to configure and customize

We have made it our goal to keep number of "settings" to the minimum and we use a lot of math to dynamically calculate the rest of settings, colors and sizes. Our paddings and margins are based on a baseline. Colors palette is also calculated based on the set of base-colors and we use capabilities of LESS to adjust the rest of the classes accordingly.

The fonts are defined only once and we enforce consistency and best practices of web design.

### Flexible Layout System

Without reliance on JavaScript - AgileToolkit CSS makes it easy to build any page layout. It can be fixed width or fluid. You can create one or several headers, footers, sidebars and content areas. You can also create a minimalistic layouts with center-aligned content or dynamic layouts which adjust their structure appropriately based on size of viewport (device) or container (resizable dialog).

### Integrated with jQuery UI, Gridpack and Fontello

![jQuery UI comparison](../doc/jqueryui.png)


AgileToolkit CSS is a great way how to make jQuery UI stylesheet look nicely and respect your overall site settings. The effect will apply to default jQuery UI widgets and also third party jQuery add-ons.

Additionally the default icons of jQuery UI will be replaced with a vector-shaped icons from fontello - much better quality icons which render crisp on retina displays. The rest of fontello icons are included too.

We bundle a flexible grid from [gridpack.com](http://gridpack.com/) which is one of the best responsive CSS Grid frameworks out there.

### How is it different to Bootstrap?

#### UI Elements

Bootstrap comes with a great amount of widgets. Adding a new widget however is difficult.

AgileToolkit CSS focuses on similarity for adding a new widget and making them consistent.

#### REMs vs Pixels

Bootstrap relies on Pixels to build sizes.

AgileToolkit CSS uses REMs and builds fonts and paddings proportionally.

#### Grid

Bootstrap has a flexible grid which changes abruptly as you resize your browser.

AgileToolkit CSS relies on 3rd party GridPack and uses flexible margin-based grid. The definition of a grid is more similar to Bootstrap v2. (span_2)

#### Forms

Because Agile Toolkit primarily targets interactive user interfaces, ability to have a flexible forms and grids are very important in Agile Toolkit and it offers higher diversity

### AgileToolkit CSS vs Foundation

Foundation is a great SASS-based framework. Many of the core principles are shared such as flexibility and extensibility. AgileToolkit CSS is different to Foundation in the following ways:

 - It's using LESS while foundation is using SASS
 - AgileToolkit CSS aims at "simplicity"
 - AgileToolkit CSS does not rely on JavaScript
 - AgileToolkit CSS focuses on use of CSS3 and HTML5 and elegant HTML, while Foundation has a better support for older browsers
 - AgileToolkit CSS integrates with jQuery UI for UI elements, while Foundation comes with it's own JavaScript framework.


### AgileToolkit CSS and Mobile Devices

Through the use of media elements Agile Toolkit CSS has some support for mobile devices, however it does not make cross-compatibility of HTML a major goal.

Your website fonts and layouts will properly adjust for your mobile device and some widgets will change their behavior, however Agile Toolkit PHP framework has a dedicated support for mobile devices - enabling you to define a different set of features for mobile device as well as use proper UI library (such as jQuery Mobile) to deliver native interface.

### AgileToolkit CSS and Agile Toolkit

Agile Toolkit CSS comes along with [Agile Toolkit PHP](http://agiletoolkit.org/) framework starting from version 4.3. This allows you to build your interface using PHP entirely and rely on standard widgets of Agile Toolkit.


## Themes and Examples

Currently there are only few test-sites using Agile Toolkit CSS:

 - http://agile55.com/
 - http://www4.agiletoolkit.org/

Agile Toolkit CSS is still BETA and you should avoid using it for production websites at this time.

## Quick Start

Clone the repository inside your project's folder. Create a 'style.less' file inside your project with the following content:

    @import '../../agiletoolkit-css/css/agiletoolkit.less';

Compile and include your own 'style.css' file.

If you find a theme you'd like to use (such as [agile55-theme](https://github.com/agile55/agile55-theme)), you can enable it like this:

    @import '../../agile55-theme/css/agile55.less';

Finally you can change some of the default settings of Agile Toolkit by adding more lines inside your style.less file:

    @bodyBackground:       'red';
    @cornerRadius:         10px;

You should only specify settings which you really wish to change. For the possible variables refer to file [variables.less](less/variables.less)

## Known Bugs

Currently there are many incomplete features in Agile Toolkit CSS:

 - IE-family browsers are not supported yet
 - Mobile device compatibility is limited
 - Class names are unstable and might change making your markup incompatible
 - jQuery UI icons may not appear properly
 - jQuery UI Dialogs are being refactored
 - States are in-progress

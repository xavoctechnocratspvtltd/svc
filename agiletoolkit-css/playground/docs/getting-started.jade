  h2 Introducing Utility Components
  .atk-box.atk-move-right.atk-col-3.atk-swatch-ink
    | Hello from Agile CSS
  p
    | Agile CSS differs from other frameworks by focusing on flexibility and
    | reusability of its design elements. The most basic components in
    | Agile CSS bring a lot of utility into HTML.

  p
    | The sample box on the right was entirely composed out of standard
    | classes without the need to write even a single line of CSS code:

  pre.atk-push
    code.html.atk-shape-rounded-top.atk-box
      = '<div class="atk-box atk-move-right atk-col-3 atk-swatch-ink">'
      br
      = '  Hello from Agile CSS'
      br
      = '</div>'

  p
    | Inside this short snippet of HTML we defined
    span.atk-label.atk-swatch-lightRed palette
    | ,&nbsp;
    span.atk-label.atk-swatch-lightRed shape
    | ,&nbsp;
    span.atk-label.atk-swatch-lightRed position
    | ,&nbsp;
    span.atk-label.atk-swatch-lightRed size
    | and
    span.atk-label.atk-swatch-lightRed spacing
    | of our element.

  p
    | As a first step working with Agile Toolkit, you need to learn about
    | all the existing components and use them for their purpose.

  p
    | The benefit of using standard styling tools is that Agile CSS makes
    | sure that any combination of components works
    | reliably and that your element interacts properly with surrounding
    | elements. For example, you could have used dark background yourself,
    | but you would have to also think about font color. Agile Toolkit
    | automatically comes up with a best text color for your selected
    | background.

  h2 Viewport-based responsive layouts
  p
    | With a wide varietty of different devices it's no longer optimal
    | to adopt your design for specific screen sizes. In Agile CSS you
    | define viewports based around your content.
  p
    | Fill your page with content, and measure what's the smallest
    | device width that can display your content reliably. Use the break point
    | to define appearance on a narrower devices or configure stretching for
    | larger devices. Agile CSS can easily shift your content between fixed
    | and fluid layouts.

  p
    | Agile CSS layouts are not based on Grid System, instead they will
    | adopt different characteristics based on size of the viewport. Grid
    | system is then used to arrange content inside areas of your layout.

  h2 Responsive Grid System
  p
    | You will find a familiar 12-column grid inside Agile Toolkit. The
    | grid is responsive and can be switched to 6, 4, 3 or 2 columns on
    | smaller devices.

  p
    | In addition to Grid system, Agile CSS also offers you cell-based
    | flexible sizing. Your cells will automatically adopt the necessary
    | width to hold your content.

  p
    | Both cell layouts and grid layouts are used in navigation bars, menus,
    | forms, footers and side-bars.

  h2 Widget Library
  p
    | Agile CSS contains an extensive library of HTML widgets you can
    | easily use on your page. Unlike other frameworks, each widget does
    | not come with a thick set of styles, instead widgets rely on base
    | components.

  p
    | A theme designer for Agile CSS will be introducing new widgets but
    | when those are developed correctly, two characteristics will apply:
    ul
        li Each widget will still look OK if HTML is copied to other theme.
        li
            | Widget can be moved to other page or inside other widget with no
            | visible deffects

  p
    | That means that a
    span.atk-label.atk-swatch-lightRed Vertical Menu
    | component can be placed inside left side-bar, top-menu pull-down or inisde
    | grid column in the center of your page.
